    This function emits a SocketIO event to one or more connected clients. A

    can only be called from a SocketIO event handler, as in obtains some
    information from the current client context. Example::

        @socketio.on("my event")
        def handle_my_custom_event(json):
            emit("my response", {"data": 42})

    :param args: A dictionary with the JSON data to send as payload.

                      Defaults to the namespace used by the originating event.
                      A ``'/'`` can be used to explicitly specify the global
                      namespace.
    :param callback: Callback function to invoke with the client's
                     acknowledgement.
    :param broadcast: ``True`` to send the message to all clients, or ``False``
                      to only reply to the sender of the originating event.
    :param to: Send the message to all the users in the given room, or to the
               user with the given session ID. If this argument is not set and
               ``broadcast`` is ``False``, then the message is sent only to the
               originating user.
    :param include_self: ``True`` to include the sender when broadcasting or
                         addressing a room, or ``False`` to send to everyone
                         but the sender.
    :param skip_sid: The session id of a client to ignore when broadcasting
                     or addressing a room. This is typically set to the
                     originator of the message, so that everyone except
                     that client receive the message. To skip multiple sids
                     pass a list.
    :param ignore_queue: Only used when a message queue is configured. If
                         set to ``True``, the event is emitted to the
                         clients directly, without going through the queue.
